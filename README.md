# CursorSpin
### A chrome extension to... spin your cursor?

This extension is not on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/) yet, however I am planning to release it soon.
This is a small little project that I made in about a week.

It was inspired by [this CSS-Tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/can-you-rotate-the-cursor-in-css/) about rotating the cursor, and thought I should make my own interpretation of it. It worked, so I made it into a chrome extension, removed bugs, and put it on GitHub.

That's all!
